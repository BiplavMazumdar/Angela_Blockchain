# Angela_Blockchain
we are learning about block chain

#Increption 
in blockchain increption is called as Hashing 
turn message into hashcode
SHA-256 popular hash algorithum 

hash should be alwase 64 characters

Blockchain means it will take previous blockhash and first block contain previous hash is 0000000000000000 or nothing

to create a block it will take nounce previous data and data 

Intrgraty of data 
Distribute blockchain 
by multiple computer means let's A,B,C are the distributer three computer has the same copy if A try to change than B and C will know A is changing some data

here we get distributed trustless ledger


# Ethereum Smart Contract

Smart Contract

by storing code into the block 

# DAPP (Decentralise Application)

In web 3 we build the company than relase the token DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)


#ICP  (The Internet Computer)
It's like we are using 2.0 web for storing data and 3.0
